# SAQ Search Tool

https://saqsearchtool.herokuapp.com

This search tool was created to navigate through the features of the SAQ API.

In an attempt to review as much of the functionality the API offers the following features have been implemented:

- dynamic group by fields with multi select drop downs (price range and country - extendible to others).
- simple pagination 
- sort by price +/-, date, random, relevancy
- filter for rated wines
- modular components

## To run locally:

git clone git@github.com:matt-szabo/saqsearchtool.git
<br>
npm install
<br>
npm start

thanks!
